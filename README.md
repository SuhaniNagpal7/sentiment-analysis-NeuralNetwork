# 📝 Sentiment Analysis using Neural Network (Keras)

This project implements a simple sentiment analysis model to classify text (e.g., reviews or tweets) as positive or negative using a neural network built with **Keras**.

---

## 💡 Overview

- Text data is tokenized and vectorized using Keras utilities.
- A fully connected neural network (using Keras Sequential API) is trained to detect sentiment.
- Supports binary sentiment classification (positive or negative).

---

## 🚀 Features

- Easy text preprocessing with Keras `Tokenizer`
- Neural network with dense layers and ReLU/Softmax activations
- Binary cross-entropy loss and accuracy tracking
- Clear visualization of training performance

## ⚙️ Usage

1️⃣ Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install tensorflow matplotlib

2️⃣ Run training:

```bash
python main.py

3️⃣ Use the trained model to predict sentiment on new sentences.
